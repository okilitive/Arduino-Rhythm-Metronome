Overview
This project is an Arduino-based rhythm and LED control system that allows users to record and playback rhythm patterns using two buttons. The system controls an array of 10 LEDs (LED bar) and a buzzer, responding to button presses by recording the timing of button events and using that data to control both the LED display and the buzzer rhythm.

Features:
Button-activated Rhythm Recording: Record timing intervals between button presses.
Rhythm Playback: Replay the recorded rhythm with synchronized LEDs and buzzer sounds.
LED Bar Control: Display a "moving" LED effect on a 10-LED array, reflecting the recorded rhythm.
Real-time Rhythm Adjustments: Dynamically adjust the buzzer rhythm speed based on recorded button press intervals.
Serial Monitoring: Monitor the rhythm intervals and LED behavior in real-time via the Serial Monitor.
Components Used:
Arduino (Any model, e.g., Uno or Nano)
10 LEDs (Connected to digital pins 4-13)
Buzzer (Connected to an analog pin)
2 Buttons (For rhythm input)
Wires and breadboard
How It Works:
Recording Rhythm: When the user presses and releases a button, the system calculates the time interval between the presses and stores it.
Playback: After enough intervals are recorded, the system will play back the rhythm, using the buzzer to create sound and the LEDs to show a corresponding visual pattern.
LED Display: LEDs will light up in a "moving" pattern, moving left-to-right or right-to-left, according to the recorded rhythm.
Real-time Output: The system prints the recorded rhythm intervals to the Serial Monitor, providing real-time feedback.
Key Features:
Dynamic Rhythm Control: Based on user input, the system adjusts the buzzer's tone interval, creating a custom rhythm.
LED Visualization: A synchronized LED display moves in response to the rhythm, providing a visual output to match the sound.
Recording Buffer: The system can store up to 400 rhythm intervals, allowing for complex rhythm patterns.
Setup:
Hardware Setup:

Connect a 10-LED array to digital pins 4-13.
Attach a buzzer to an analog pin (e.g., A1).
Set up two buttons (Button 3 and Button 4) for recording the rhythm on pins 2 and 3 respectively.
Upload the Code:

Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor to view the real-time rhythm intervals and system status.
Usage:
Button A0: When pressed, records the interval between the current and last button press. The interval is used to control the buzzer rhythm.
Button 3: Records a "1" in the rhythm pattern when pressed.
Button 4: Records a "0" in the rhythm pattern when pressed.
LED Display: The LEDs will show a moving light pattern corresponding to the recorded rhythm, with the buzzer playing sounds based on the intervals.
