# Arduino-Rhythm-Metronome

This project is an Arduino-based rhythm with LED system. Besides common rhythm function, it allows users to record and playback rhythm patterns using two buttons. The system controls an array of 10 LEDs (1*10 LED bar) to respond the recorded rhythm pattern.

# Components and supplies
1 Arduino Uno<br>
10 LEDs (or 1 1*10 LED bar) <br>
1 Buzzer<br>
3 Buttons<br>
Wires and breadboards

#Functions

This project enables two main functions for the Arduino platform.

1. Common Metronome: After connecting the device to power, pressing the metronome button (connected to the port A0) with a stable pace will trigger the buzzer to play a rhythm that matches the pace you input. This can be used as a common metronome aid to assist with music performance. Furthermore, the LED bar will display the time interval between two consecutive paces.

2. Rhythm Player: users can use two buttons (connected to ports ~2 and ~3) to record the rhythm and playback the recorded rhythm patterns on the LED bar under the pace setted in the Common Metronome function. When I was a begineer of the saxphone, I found that reading the staff and understanding which note and how long were in a short time is difficult. So it is hard for me to match my music with the pace rhythm from the metronome, whihc is the target why I write this project. After you recording the staff, the led point will start moving on the LED bar with time passing. On way from this side to the other side stands for a note on the staff. The time of on way moving is different, depending on how long the note is. The detailed operation steps are followed:
   
   i> First, user should use the function 1 (Common Metronome) to set the basic pace rhythm. Then, user should press the two buttons (connected to ports ~2 and ~3) at the same time, meaning the start of recording the staff;
   ii> For easy explaination, pressing the button connected to port ~3 one time is recorded as "0" and pressing the button connected to port ~2 one time is recorded as "1". "0" is used for segementing the note and note; "1" is used for recording the length of a note, and each "1" stands for 1/4 beat. User can use these two buttons to record the length of each note in the staff and press the two buttons (connected to ports ~2 and ~3) at the same time again to finish.
   iii> Given a simple here.

   The above staff could be recorded as "01(together) 0 1111 0 1111 0 11111111 0 11 0 1111 0 111111 01(together)" (the space is just for easily understanding). 
   iv> After finishing recording, the LED bar will all lighting for 3 times and then start display the rhythm of staff.

There is a demo video for these two functions:
